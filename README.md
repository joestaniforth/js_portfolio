# Prostate Pipeline

The prostate pipeline is a project that takes a vcf file, or directory containing vcf files and returns a csv containing lifetime risk of prostate cancer. 
Currently, this is proof of concept, and would require some optimizations before use. Additionally, a bed file + vcftools can be used to filter the vcf, making it much more lightweight.
